# ðŸ”§ Play-Once Behavior Fix Summary

## ðŸš¨ **Problem Identified**
Audio was playing multiple times instead of just once per session because:

1. **Local State Issue**: Each `useVoiceNarration` hook instance had its own local `hasPlayedOnce` state
2. **Page Navigation Reset**: When navigating between pages, new hook instances were created with fresh state
3. **Multiple Components**: Some pages had multiple VoiceControl components that could trigger the same audio
4. **Race Conditions**: Multiple components could check "has been played" simultaneously before any marked it as played

## âœ… **Solution Implemented**

### 1. **Global Play-Once Tracking**
- Moved `hasPlayedOnce` state from local hook to global `AudioContext`
- All components now share the same play-once tracking across the entire application
- State persists during page navigation

### 2. **Enhanced AudioContext** (`Client/src/context/AudioContext.jsx`)
```javascript
// Added global play-once tracking
const [hasPlayedOnce, setHasPlayedOnce] = useState(new Set());

// Added helper functions
const hasStepBeenPlayed = useCallback((step) => {
  return hasPlayedOnce.has(step);
}, [hasPlayedOnce]);

const markStepAsPlayed = useCallback((step) => {
  setHasPlayedOnce(prev => new Set([...prev, step]));
}, []);
```

### 3. **Updated useVoiceNarration Hook** (`Client/src/hooks/useVoiceNarration.js`)
- Removed local `hasPlayedOnce` state
- Now uses global `hasStepBeenPlayed()` and `markStepAsPlayed()` functions
- Consistent play-once behavior across all components

### 4. **Improved VoiceControl Component** (`Client/src/Components/VoiceControl.jsx`)
- Uses global `hasStepBeenPlayed()` function directly from context
- Better race condition prevention with double-checking in setTimeout
- Proper dependency management in useEffect

## ðŸŽ¯ **Key Changes**

### Before (Broken):
```javascript
// Each component had its own local state
const [hasPlayedOnce, setHasPlayedOnce] = useState(new Set());

// Check was done locally
if (!forcePlay && hasPlayedOnce.has(step)) {
  return; // This failed across page navigation
}
```

### After (Fixed):
```javascript
// Global state shared across all components
const { hasStepBeenPlayed, markStepAsPlayed } = useGlobalAudio();

// Check is done globally
if (!forcePlay && hasStepBeenPlayed(step)) {
  return; // This works across page navigation
}
```

## ðŸ”„ **How It Works Now**

1. **First Visit**: Audio plays automatically and step is marked as played globally
2. **Page Navigation**: Global state persists, step remains marked as played
3. **Subsequent Visits**: `hasStepBeenPlayed(step)` returns true, audio doesn't auto-play
4. **Manual Replay**: Users can still manually replay using controls (forcePlay=true)
5. **Session Reset**: Play-once tracking resets only on page refresh

## ðŸ§ª **Testing Results**

### âœ… **Fixed Scenarios**:
- âœ… Audio plays only once per session when navigating between pages
- âœ… Multiple VoiceControl components on same page don't cause duplicates
- âœ… Global state persists across page navigation
- âœ… Manual replay still works when user clicks replay button
- âœ… No race conditions between multiple components

### ðŸŽµ **Audio Flow**:
1. **Landing Page**: Step 1 plays once âœ…
2. **Elections Page**: Step 2 plays once âœ…  
3. **Voting Page**: Step 4 plays once âœ…
4. **Login Page**: Step 5 plays once âœ…
5. **MetaMask Overlay**: Step 6 plays once âœ…
6. **Vote Slip**: Step 6 doesn't play again (already played) âœ…

## ðŸŒŸ **Benefits**

- **Better UX**: No annoying repeated audio
- **Consistent Behavior**: Same experience across all pages
- **Performance**: Prevents unnecessary audio loading
- **Accessibility**: Still allows manual replay when needed
- **Global Management**: Centralized audio state management

## ðŸ”§ **Technical Details**

### Global State Structure:
```javascript
// AudioContext state
hasPlayedOnce: Set(['landing', 'verify', 'thankyou']) // Example after user journey
```

### Component Usage:
```javascript
// Any component can check/mark played status
const { hasStepBeenPlayed, markStepAsPlayed } = useGlobalAudio();

if (!hasStepBeenPlayed('landing')) {
  // Play audio and mark as played
  playGlobalAudio('/audio/step1_landing.mp3', 'landing');
  markStepAsPlayed('landing');
}
```
